What kind of man
What kind of man am I?
I try to walk where I just fell
I try to break a secret spell
In your eyes I feel the flames of love

Flames of love 
Flames of love 
I'm drowning in the sea of love
And enough is never enough
When I find myself deep in your eyes
Over and over again
Flames of love

What kind of fool
What kind of fool am I?
I look for shadows in the sun
For memories of days to come
In your eyes I feel the flames of love
