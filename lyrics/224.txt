$1 w1
A part of me | Is feeling weak
I took a chance, but now it feels so hard to breathe
A leap of faith | Now haunting me
What happened to the words "it's always you and me"
$ w2
I wanna feel alive
When I'm running through my life
So help me to ignite
This spark I feel inside
So help me now

Light me up, Light me up now, baby
Light me up, Tell me where to go
Light me up, Light me up now, baby
Light me up And tell me where to go

I’m fading now | Of real life
Misguided by the way they say I have to live
So bring me back | Back to the place
Where my heart can finally reveal its face 
$ w2
I wanna feel alive
When I'm running through my life
So help me to ignite
This spark I feel inside
So help me now
