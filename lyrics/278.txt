Holiday in Paris
Sunday afternoon
Meeting a French girl
Evening walk by moon
So we were dancing on the music
And I was waiting for my chance
Aj onli didn't anderstend her
łen szi sed in frencz

Fell in love in Paris
Didn't know what to do
Walking with my girl
Rendez-vous for two
Aj łos afreid tu kis maj bejbi
Didn't noł łot szid sej
Drinking wine by evening
In a small café
$ w2
I ask her to kiss me
Asked for something more
She didn't understand me
Like I didn't before
