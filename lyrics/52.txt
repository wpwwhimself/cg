I thought love was only true in fairy tales 
Meant for someone else but not for me 
Love was out to get me, that's the way it seems 
Disappointment haunted all my dreams 
$R
And then I saw her face 
Now I'm a believer 
Not a trace 
Of doubt in my mind 
I'm in love, oooooh...
I'm a believer, I couldn't leave her if I tried 
$2
I thought love was more or less a given thing 
But the more I gave the less I got, oh yeah 
What's the use in trying, all you get is pain 
When I wanted sunshine I got rain
