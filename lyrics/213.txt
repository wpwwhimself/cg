Oh, I cannot explain, Every time it's the same
Oh, I feel that it's real, Take my heart
I've been lonely to long, Oh, I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romance, Take my heart
I need you so There's no time
I'll never go

Cheri, cheri lady
Going through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart.
Cheri, cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take your part
$
Cheri, cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart, don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby I'll be always yours

I get up, I get down. All my world turns around
Who is right? Who is wrong? I don't know
I've got pain in my heart, Got a love in my soul
Easy come, but I think easy go
I need you so All the times
I move so slow
