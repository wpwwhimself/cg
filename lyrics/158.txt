You're a good soldier 
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up
And dust yourself off
And back in the saddle
$
You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious
We're getting closer
This isn't over
$
The pressure's on, you feel it
But you've got it all, believe it
$
When you fall, get up, oh oh...
And if you fall, get up, eh eh...

Listen to your God
This is our motto
Your time to shine
Don't wait in line
Y vamos por todo

People are raising
Their expectations
Go on and feed them
This is your moment
No hesitations
$
Today's your day, I feel it
You paved the way, believe it

If you get down, get up, oh oh...
When you get down, get up eh eh...
