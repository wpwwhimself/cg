@001I've been waiting for so long
Now I've finally found someone to stand by me
@100We saw the writing on the wall
As we felt this magical fantasy
@501Now with passion in our eyes
There's no way we could disguise it secretly
So we take each other's hand
'Cause we seem to understand the urgency
@001Just remember

@100You're the one thing
@001I can't get enough of
@100So I'll tell you something
@101This could be love @103because

@100With my body and soul
I want you more than you'll ever know
@001So we'll just let it go
Don't be afraid to lose control, no
@100Yes, I know what's on your mind
When you say, "Stay with me tonight"
@001Stay with me / Just remember
