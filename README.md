# The Black Pears Market -- Event Band's Library

This website was created waaay back in the day, for the sole purpose of **managing my event band's repertoire**, as an upgrade from hundreds of pages of lyrics pages.

The whole system was created from scratch by me, using **PHP** and basic **JS**. It's features include:
- list of songs with their metadata and lyrics
- extensive lyrics display, supporting extended symbols and my own sheet music engine
- custom markdown-like engine for processing lyrics
- filtering of songs, with alphabetical grouping

The name, as always, refers to my ad-hoc system of naming new IT projects.

The website is still functional under http://cg.audio-z.wpww.pl/ -- for the Observer's experience type in the password `CGOBSERVER`
