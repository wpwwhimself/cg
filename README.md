# The Black Pears Market -- Event Band's Library

This website was created waaay back in the day, for the sole purpose of managing my event band's repertoire 🎷 It was my very first big project and I am helluva proud of it 😁

The name, as always, refers to my ad-hoc system of naming new IT projects -- they all came from some vegetable or fruit.

The whole system was created from scratch by me, using **PHP** and basic **JS**. It was created as an upgrade from hundreds of pages of lyrics bound in massive ring binders 📒 It made the whole setup quicker, more convenient and windproof 💨

## Features
- 🗄️ list of songs with their metadata and lyrics
- 🎤 extensive lyrics display, supporting extended symbols
- 🎶 my own custom sheet music engine (I didn't know ABC at that time)
- 📝 custom markdown-like engine for processing lyrics
- 📶 filtering of songs, with alphabetical grouping

## Links
